Build a Windows app called “Import Folder Cleanup” that helps organize and rename folders and files from bulk media downloads. Each folder corresponds to one Reddit post and may have messy names like “112j23_My_test_post”. The app should offer customizable and flexible folder renaming options, such as deleting the first X characters, deleting everything before or after a character, or removing digits/special characters. After cleaning the folder name (e.g., converting “112j23_My_test_post” to “My test Post”), the app should rename all files inside that folder to match the new folder name, adding numbered suffixes if there are multiple files (e.g., “My test Post.jpg”, “My test Post 2.jpg”). The program should also detect when a folder contains two related video files (e.g., separate video and audio streams, like .mp4 and .m4a or .webm and .audio) and automatically combine them into a single playable video using FFmpeg, which is already installed. Prioritize accuracy in matching video/audio pairs and ensure cleanup operations happen in the correct order: folder renaming, file renaming, then optional merging. Can this be done or do you have any questions?
